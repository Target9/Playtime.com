This is a prototype i am 12 yo and this is my fun little project where you can see how much Roblox some one plays

How it works

You lanch the python script on an computer and then you set up a webserver running the webserver. you will also need to ajust the python file so it sends stuff to the webserver

I have added comments so you can see what the code does

This is a beta version

Please add me on discord or comment if you have ideas on what i shoud update/make
